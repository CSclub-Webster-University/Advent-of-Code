# <p align="center"> How to Participate in Advent of Code </p>

You’ve seen an example of an Advent of Code puzzle. 
Next, you’ll learn how you can submit your answer for it. 
You never submit any code to solve the puzzles. 
You just submit the answer, which is usually a number or a text string.

In general, you’ll follow a series of steps to solve a puzzle on the site:

1. **Log in** on the Advent of Code website. You do this by using your credentials from another service like GitHub, Google, Twitter, or Reddit.

1. **Read** the puzzle text and pay special attention to the given example. You should make sure you understand the solution for the example data.

1. **Download** your personalized input for the puzzle. You’ll need this input in order to find your unique answer to the problem.

1. **Code up your solution.** This is the fun part, which you’ll get a lot of practice for in the rest of this tutorial.

1. **Enter your answer** to the puzzle on the puzzle page. If your answer is correct, then you earn a golden star and part two of the puzzle is opened up.

1. **Repeat** steps 2 to 4 for part two of the puzzle. This second part is similar to the first, but it usually adds some twist requiring you to adapt your code.

1. **Enter your second answer** on the puzzle page in order to earn your second star and finish the puzzle.
